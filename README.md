# Sensitivity Analysis on Lalonde


This is code to run sensitivity analysis based on the paper 'Identification, Inference and Sensitivity Analysis for Causal Mediation Effects' (2010)  on the 1974 Lalonde Report's dataset.

I use marriage as a mediator for the actual treatment effect.

**If it takes too long to run, you can increase the rho.by parameter on line 12**
